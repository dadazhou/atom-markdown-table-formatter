# Markdown Table Formatter

A simple markdown plugin to format tables.

Based on the awesome [Improved Markdown table commands for TextMate](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/03/improved-markdown-table-commands-for-textmate/) work from [Dr. Drang (@drdrang)](https://twitter.com/drdrang)

Sorry to anyone using my package, had some troubles with git and remote tags.

Hope this fixes everything.
